.SH NAME

.P
\fBsynclink\fR \- program to keep two directories synchronised using hard links.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.P
\fBsynclink\fR [option] source_dir destination_dir.

.P
Both directories must be input by the user.

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
\fBsynclink\fR causes the destination directory to be an exact hard linked
copy of the source. Files which are copies rather than links will be deleted and replaced by a linked version. Directories required in the destination are created as necessary. All file system objects in the destination but not in the source are deleted.

.P
Some errors are fatal but some file and dir handling errors are not. These errors are sent to \fIstderr\fR. It may be useful to redirect such errors to a file. Eg: 2> errors.lst.

.P
File system objects other than directories and regular files are ignored.

.SH OPTIONS

 \fB\-h\fR
