README for synclink.
Syncronises the contenst of souce dir with that of destination dir.
1. Creates dirs in destination that match those in source if they don't
exist.
2. Checks corresponding file and symlinks in both source and destination
that they have the same inode number. If not the destination object is
deleted and then a hard link to the source object is created.
3. Deletes all file system objects that exist in destination that do not
exist in source.
4. Considers only files, dirs and symlinks. All other file system
objects are ignored.

See INSTALLATION for building instructions.
